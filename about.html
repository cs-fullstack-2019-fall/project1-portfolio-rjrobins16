<p>
    I am a full stack web-developer and graphic designer specializing in Javascript and Python. With 10 years of Photoshop experience,
    an affinity for aesthetics and a love for logic, my skillset has equipped me to create simple yet user friendly programs.
I believe the beauty of things are in their details and approach each project with the goal to build it better than expected.
    During my time with CodeCrew, I have become more social and able to explain code in a way that is relative to many. Being a software developer has increased
    my confidence, expanded my creativity and boosted my career opportunities. I look forward to creating
functional applications that solve every day problems and make an impact to every user. </p>
